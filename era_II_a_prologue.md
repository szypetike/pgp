Chapter 11: The First Polleneers of Ram 11

April 20, 2456 AD, 12:36 UTCOnboard Apium 1, Captain's Log Entry:
"We have reached the heliopause. We are now officially in interstellar space. As per mission parameters, the interstellar legal frameworks of the Beijing Convention are no longer binding. All operations will now proceed under the regulations outlined in the Project Galactic Pollen (PGP) charter. Ship's systems remain fully functional. Current fuel level is 99.98%. We achieved a cruising velocity of 3% of the speed of light at 00:22 hours this cycle. We continue to accelerate at the desired rate of approximately 0.223 m/s2 and anticipate full disengagement from laser propulsion and transfer to beam-core power in 14,356 seconds. Over and out."
The log application terminated, the nostalgic voice-command protocol falling silent. The ship's captain, a sleek android of polished chrome and carbon fiber, pushed off from a zero-gravity handhold, its movements a silent, efficient ballet. It drifted through the ship's core, a ghost in the machine, on its way to perform the most critical task in its unending routine: checking on the precious cargo of the Apium.
The shipment was housed one-third of the ship's length from the bow, nestled behind the optimal configuration of material and magnetic shielding—a sanctuary from both the cold radiation of the void and the fierce emissions of its own engines. Contained within a housing the size of a small terrestrial vehicle were two stacked, interconnected units. The top section was a cryogenic DNA vault, a library of humanity's genetic legacy, cooled and monitored by a host of diagnostic systems. Robotic arms, poised over vials and chemicals, stood ready to initiate the first steps of creation. Below it lay the genesis chamber, a bio-foundry designed to sculpt flesh and consciousness from the genetic blueprints passed down from above. The DNA, cryo-frozen to a stable state, was projected to remain viable for millennia. Together, the two units formed a perfect automated womb, capable of birthing the next generation of human settlers.
This design, combined with its state-of-the-art cloning system, its autonomous captain, and its meticulously planned trajectory, gave the Apium a simulated mission success rate of 1.5%—a figure that, while grim, was a hundredfold improvement over any previous model. The astro-settler schools still cautioned that all simulations were inherently "messy," but the consensus was clear: the Apium was the breakthrough humanity had been waiting for. It was this prediction that finally convinced Intersettler Inc. to commit, moving its grandest ambition from computer models into the unforgiving reality of space. The PGP was the most expensive single galactic expedition to date, yet it was a bargain compared to the financial black holes of terraforming missions, which had consumed generations of resources with little to show for it.
The Apium carried enough fuel to investigate thirty potential worlds. Its first destination was Ram 11, an Earth-like planet orbiting the brown dwarf Gliese 163, thirty-two light-years from Sol. It would take 128 years to arrive. Data suggested Ram 11 possessed an atmosphere so close to Earth's that an active biosphere was all but guaranteed. This was the core principle of the PGP missions: not to build a new cradle for humanity, but to find one already occupied and claim it. Intersettler Inc. preferred the term "introduction of the human species," but the operational reality was invasion.
Upon arrival, the ship would spend nearly a year in orbit, deploying its swarms of micro-probes. These insect-like drones, powered by tiny nuclear batteries, would descend to the surface, testing, sampling, and dissecting the planet's secrets. They would taste the air, drink the water, and analyze the local life, autonomously beaming their findings back to the ship's powerful AI. Only when the planet was certified with a 99% safety rating would the Apium risk a landing and begin its true work: to plant the seed of humanity in alien soil.
