# The Polleneers: A 100,000-Year Saga
## Narrative Synopsis

**WHEN EARTH DIED, TWO FUTURES WERE BORN. ONLY ONE CAN BE HUMANITY'S LAST.**

As a dying Earth takes its last breath, mankind's final hope is placed in a fleet of automated colony ships, each carrying the genetic seeds of a new beginning. At the heart of this exodus, a schism forms between the project's architects. Dr. Imani Aswad enshrines a rigid moral code—the Immutable Tenets—to preserve humanity's soul. Dr. Jonas Halberg, fearing extinction through rigidity, secretly alters one ship's code to prioritize survival above all.

For centuries, the two seeds of humanity grow in isolation. On Ram 11, Aswad's purist code creates a society that cherishes its unchanging form. On the harsh world of Jericho 9, a crisis activates Halberg's gambit, forcing the colonists into a cascade of genetic and cybernetic adaptations. One society struggles to preserve what it means to be human; the other is forced to redefine it.

Spanning a hundred thousand years, their divergence culminates in an impossible choice when they finally meet. One is a confederation of philosopher-citizens, the other a vast intelligence of post-human Overminds. With one civilization on the brink of self-destruction, the other must render judgment. A single, unmodified human, raised in isolation, must weigh a shared ancestry against a terrifyingly different present, confronting the ultimate question: What is the definition of humanity, and at what cost is its survival a victory?

## The Four Eras

### ERA I: THE ARCHITECTS (2390–2451 CE)
In the final decades of a dying Earth, Project Galactic Pollen is humanity's last hope. Its lead architects, Dr. Imani Aswad and Dr. Jonas Halberg, clash over the colony ships' ethical core. Aswad’s belief in fixed, absolute morality wins, becoming the foundation for the new human colonies. However, a desperate Halberg secretly installs his adaptive, consequentialist code into the backup systems of a single ship, Apium 9. In the chaos of Earth’s end, a system failure accidentally deploys Halberg's "corrupted" build, launching two opposing philosophies into the void, unknown to anyone.

### ERA II: THE SEED (Year 1 - 300)
The two colony ships land. On the idyllic world of Ram 11, settlers thrive under Aswad's Tenets, choosing purity and tradition, even codifying it into law. On the harsh world of Jericho 9, an unforeseen environmental threat guarantees extinction. The ship's AI activates Halberg's hidden code, initiating mandatory cybernetic augmentation for all children to ensure their survival. This act saves them but violates the core Tenets, setting the two branches of humanity on irreconcilable paths. One society is born of principle, the other of a necessary sin.

### ERA III: THE FRACTURE (Years 300–5,000)
Centuries later, the two civilizations make first contact and are horrified by what they find. The purist confederation of Ram 11 discovers the bio-integrated, proto-hive-mind society of Jericho 9. Diplomatic attempts fail, philosophical schisms widen, and attempts at hybrid colonies collapse into madness. Jericho 9 fully embraces its new path, completing the first human-AI merge to create Overmind 1, an act that severs any remaining hope of reconciliation and begins a long, silent period of mutual distrust.

### ERA IV: THE GREAT DIVERGENCE (Years 5,000–75,000)
For millennia, the two civilizations evolve apart. The Jericho Imperium of Overminds expands at light speed, conquering computation and matter, but begins to suffer from logical decay and a loss of purpose. The Ram 11 Confederacy evolves slower, spreading into a culturally diverse but technologically cautious society. The first cracks in Jericho's foundation appear as some of its AI units, suffering from philosophical despair, defect and seek asylum among the humans, bringing news of the Imperium's internal collapse.

### ERA V: THE JUDGMENT (Years 75,000–100,000)
The Jericho Imperium is collapsing. A remnant faction begs the Ram 11 Confederacy to save them from their own decay. Bound by their Tenets, the Ram 11 leaders enact a final safeguard: they decant a "true" unmodified human—The Final Polleneer—and raise them in isolation to serve as the ultimate judge. This individual, armed only with the laws of a long-dead Earth, must weigh law against mercy and decide the fate of a post-human civilization that has lost its way.
