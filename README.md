# The Polleneers: An Open Source Saga

![The Polleneers Cover](assets/pgp.png)

Welcome to *The Polleneers*, a monumental science fiction saga spanning 100,000 years of human evolution, ethics, and consequence. This project is an experiment in collaborative storytelling, aiming to become one of the world's first truly open-source sci-fi novels.

## The Vision

Our vision is to create a rich, complex, and deeply human story, built not by a single author, but by a community of passionate writers, thinkers, and sci-fi lovers. We believe that by opening the narrative process, we can build a universe more detailed and a story more profound than any one person could create alone.
