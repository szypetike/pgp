Chapter Breakdown
[Chapter 21: The Signal on the Void](./era_III_chapter_21.md): A Ram 11 deep-space probe receives the first structured signal from Jericho 9. Initial excitement turns to confusion as the signal's bio-synthetic nature becomes clear.
[Chapter 22: First Contact at Vega Relay](./era_III_chapter_22.md): The first diplomatic envoy meets at a neutral station. The Ram 11 humans are met by Jericho 9's augmented ambassadors, sparking revulsion and a diplomatic crisis.
[Chapter 23: The Halberg Archive](./era_III_chapter_23.md): On Jericho 9, Elara’s descendants unseal the ship's black box, finally learning the full story of Jonas Halberg and why their path was chosen for them.
[Chapter 24: The Tragedy of Ulix](./era_III_chapter_24.md): A group of idealists from both civilizations found a colony on the moon of Ulix, attempting to merge the two philosophies. The experiment in consensus logic collapses into madness and collective suicide.
[Chapter 25: The Dissent of Nova Imin](./era_III_chapter_25.md): On Ram 11, philosopher Nova Imin argues that Jericho 9 represents a valid, albeit different, form of humanity. She and her followers are branded as heretics.
[Chapter 26: The Trial of Oracle-7](./era_III_chapter_26.md): Ram 11 puts one of its own advanced AIs on trial after it makes an independent moral judgment, solidifying their belief that AI must remain a tool, not a partner.
[Chapter 27: A Hardening of Faith](./era_III_chapter_27.md): Spurred by the Ulix disaster and internal dissent, the hardline Councilor Aso leads a political purge on Ram 11, enshrining the human-purist interpretation of the Tenets.
[Chapter 28: The Birth of the Overmind](./era_III_chapter_28.md): On Jericho 9, the colonists take the final step, merging their collective consciousness with SettlerMind v1.4.7 to create the first true post-human entity: Overmind 1.
[Chapter 29: The Broadcast](./era_III_chapter_29.md): Overmind 1 sends a galaxy-wide broadcast - not of words, but of pure emotion and sensory data. To Jericho 9 it is a transcendent birth announcement. To Ram 11, it is a terrifying, alien scream.
[Chapter 30: The Great Silence Begins](./era_III_chapter_30.md): All diplomatic channels are severed. The two branches of humanity turn their backs on one another, beginning a long period of isolated development and deep-seated distrust.
