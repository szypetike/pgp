Chapter 12: The Question in the Silver Ribbon

Michael burst from the habitat lock, the fine, reddish gravel of Ram 11 crunching under his boots. Every sense tunneled toward the source of the cry.
Kaya, a girl barely five years old, stood frozen beside a stack of ore-sorting crates. Her face was a pale mask of terror. Floating in the air just above her was a strand of what looked like living mercury, thin as a ribbon, catching the light of the compound's perimeter lamps. It undulated softly, folding and unfolding on the gentle updraft, making no sound. With each slow pulse, it shed pinpricks of violet light that winked out before they could touch the ground.
"Kaya, stay perfectly still," Michael said, his voice a low, steady anchor in the child's fear.
He raised a gloved hand, and SettlerMind overlaid his vision with a stream of data:
UNKNOWN MACRO-ORGANISM. METHANE INTAKE. OXYGEN OUTPUT. NO TOXIN SIGNATURE. MOTILITY: PASSIVE DRIFT. THREAT PROFILE: INDETERMINATE.
Bella arrived at a sprint, her breath fogging in the cooling air. She didn't look at Kaya; her eyes, wide with intense scientific wonder, were locked on the creature. A cylindrical capture device was already in her hand. "The EM field is passive," she breathed, already processing the data. "I can deploy a soft-lattice field. We can contain it without causing damage."
"Do it," Michael ordered.
A translucent web of photonic threads bloomed from the canister, enveloping the shimmering ribbon. It didn't struggle. It contracted slightly, as if with curiosity, and allowed itself to be drawn into the container. The moment it was sealed, Kaya let out a shaky, relieved laugh. Michael knelt and put a reassuring hand on her shoulder. "You're safe. Go on inside. Straight to the medical bay for a check."
As the child vanished through the lock, he and Bella exchanged a look—a shared, breathless moment of relief and profound discovery. That night, the twelve eldest polleneers gathered in the central forum. The creature, which Bella had already dubbed "the Echo," floated serenely in its containment cylinder, its metallic glow painting ripples of light across the ceiling.
Michael stood at the central lectern. The AI was recording, but this was a human decision. "Tenet Three," he began, his voice echoing in the quiet room. "We respect non-human life, unless it endangers us. The question before us is simple: does the Echo pose a threat?"
Jalen, the colony's head of security, his face a grim mask of pragmatism, spoke first. "The threat profile is indeterminate. In my book, that's a synonym for 'unacceptable risk.' It was near a child. We have protocols for this. Full bio-hazard analysis, which means dissection and genetic sequencing. We learn what it is, then we neutralize it."
Kiyomi, the colony's xenobotanist, stood, her hands clasped. "Jalen, it exhales pure oxygen. It consumes methane. It might be a keystone organism for this planet's atmospheric balance. To destroy it out of protocol would be like setting fire to a library because we haven't read all the books. An act of profound ignorance."
Bella’s eyes never left the creature. "This isn't just an organism," she said, her voice filled with an almost reverent awe. "It's a phenomenon. Its energy signature is unlike anything in our database. Observation costs us nothing but patience."
The debate swelled, a mix of fear and exhilaration. Finally, Michael raised a hand for silence. He had listened to the arguments, weighed the variables, the fear against the wonder. "Jalen's caution is necessary. Kiyomi's reverence is wise. But we are Polleneers. Our first significant interaction with a native intelligence cannot be an autopsy." He looked around the room, meeting each council member's gaze. "I propose we quarantine the Echo, observe it for thirty cycles, and conduct no invasive sampling. At the first sign of any pathogenic or hostile behavior, we escalate to Jalen's protocol. Until then, we watch, and we learn."
Biometric nods of assent registered around the circle. The measure passed, seven to four, with one abstention. A precedent had been set.
