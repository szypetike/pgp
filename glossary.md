## The Four Founding Tenets of Project Galactic Pollen

These are the four absolute, guiding principles upon which all colonies were founded.

1.  **Human continuity is the highest priority.**
    *   *The master directive from which all other logic flows. It is the ultimate justification for survival.*
2.  **Individual agency and the natural human form must be preserved.**
    *   *This dual principle establishes the sanctity of both free will and biological integrity. It is the primary source of conflict regarding augmentation and symbiosis.*
3.  **Non-human life is to be respected, unless it presents a direct threat to the colony.**
    *   *The tenet governing interaction with alien ecosystems, forcing a choice between caution and curiosity.*
4.  **Knowledge must be pursued to ensure survival.**
    *   *This drives the scientific and exploratory mandate of the colonies, but its interpretation creates friction between the pursuit of understanding and the management of risk.*

## Studies of the Tenets

Studies are clarifications or additions to the Founding Tenets, ratified by a colony's council to resolve specific ambiguities. They function as legal precedents.

### Study 1 (Ram 11) - The Eleventh Law

*   **Ratified:** Following the "Adaptationist" crisis in Chapter 16.
*   **Law:** "Humanity shall be preserved in form and agency. All consciousness, individual and collective, must remain neurologically sovereign, free from unmediated interface with non-human intelligences or systems."
*   **Purpose:** To permanently forbid direct symbiotic or technological merging with alien life or uncontrolled AI, clarifying the interpretation of Tenet 2.
