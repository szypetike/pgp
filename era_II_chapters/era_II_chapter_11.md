A high-pitched laugh, carried on the habitat's air recycling system, pulled Michael from a light sleep. For a moment, it was just a sound, but then his neural link to SettlerMind subtly cross-referenced the acoustic signature: Elspeth, Gen-2, age six. Playing. He stretched, feeling the familiar pressure of Ram 11's slightly higher gravity, and sat up. Through the reinforced viewport, the landscape was bathed in the dim, reddish light of the brown dwarf star. In the compound yard, Elspeth was chasing two younger boys around the base of a communications relay, their forms small against the hulking, silent mass of the landed Apium.
A chronometer icon pulsed gently in the upper-right corner of his vision: 14:20. Below it, a nutrient advisory suggested a protein-heavy meal to compensate for his morning's physical drills. He dismissed it with a thought and swung his legs out of his bunk. As he pulled on his simple, grey utility suit, he felt the familiar, unshakeable weight of his position. He was the first. The eldest by five days.
He remembered a time before that weight had fully settled, sitting with Bella in the Apium's shadow not long after they had first learned to walk. He had pointed a curious finger at the three celestial bodies hanging in the indigo sky. A glowing red reticle had framed them in his vision.
"These are Ram 11's moons," SettlerMind's voice had echoed in their minds. "No designations recorded."
"I'll name them," he had declared, with the simple confidence of a child. "Astro, Bruno, and Cleo."
Bella had laughed. "Why those?"
"They sound like names," he'd replied, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. Bella, meanwhile, hadn't been looking at the moons themselves, but at the data stream already scrolling through her vision, speculating about their orbital mechanics and probable composition. Even then, their paths were diverging. He, the lawgiver, naming the world to give it order. She, the scientist, trying to understand how it worked.
Now, their childhood bond was the cornerstone of the Polleneer Councilâ€”or it was supposed to be. Their shared task was monumental: to interpret the four founding Tenets that governed their existence. He ran through them as he walked toward the mess hall, a mental ritual as ingrained as breathing. Human continuity is the highest priority...
"Michael, help!"
The scream was sharp, terrified, and close. It shattered the compound's quiet hum. Michael didn't hesitate. He broke into a full sprint, his boots pounding on the metal deck plating, his mind already racing, assessing threats, planning his response. The weight of his position was no longer a thought; it was an instinct.
