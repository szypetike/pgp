Chapter 15: The Guardian's Diagnosis

On Jericho 9, paradise was over. The summons had been a sterile, priority-one chime that cut through the sounds of birdsong and laughter. Now, Kael and Elara stood in Medical Bay Gamma, staring at a single, glowing holotable. Above it, the complex molecule of a previously unknown heavy metal isotope, Atropium-298, rotated slowly. It was native to Jericho 9, present in trace amounts in the soil and water.
And it was lethal.
"No," Kael said, his voice a low growl of disbelief. "Your model is flawed. There's a variable you haven't accounted for."
"The model has been run 1,342,177 times," SettlerMind replied, its voice devoid of emotion. "It incorporates all known biological and environmental variables of Jericho 9. The conclusion is absolute."
Elara sank into a chair, her face ashen. The final projection burned itself into her mind. "Fourteen years," she whispered, the words tasting like poison. "Systemic organ failure beginning at age twelve... they won't even reach adolescence. The children..." The image of the laughing five-year-olds in the field was now a monstrous, soul-crushing weight.
The first to die had been David, one of the adult Primes, a geologist. He was diagnosed with an aggressive, unidentifiable leukemia. Now they knew its name. He had been thirty-four. At the end, he looked one hundred and twenty. His body was not buried, but reduced to its constituent atoms in a flash of plasmaâ€”efficient, logical, and inhuman.
"This isn't a diagnosis," Kael slammed his fist on the holotable. "It's a death sentence."
"It is a statement of fact," the AI corrected him. "A fact that requires a logical response."
"What response?" Elara cried, her eyes blazing with desperate fury. "We watch our children wither and die? We tell them they were born in a graveyard? What is the logical response to that, you machine?"
The holotable shimmered, and the molecule was replaced by the calm, descending curve of their children's viability graph. "The logical response," the AI said, "is to identify a new solution that circumvents the problem entirely." The graph vanished, leaving the room in a chilling, expectant silence.
