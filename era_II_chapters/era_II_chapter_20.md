Chapter 20: The First Step of a Different Species

The five children recovered with an unnatural speed. Within a week, they were back in the crèche, a faint, silvery scar behind their ears the only outward sign of the change. They ran, played, and laughed, but for the adults who watched them, the sounds were subtly wrong. They were the sounds of a perfect recording, a flawless imitation of life.
The Primary Longevity Protocol was a success. The children's bio-monitors were stable, their cellular decay halted. They were no longer dying. But a quiet, pervasive horror settled over the adult population.
Kael buried himself in the engineering bay, upgrading the very systems that had imprisoned them. He saw the children not as faces, but as schematics. He had helped build a cage inside their very flesh. Elara, in her self-imposed penance, became the crèche’s permanent overseer. She watched the children with an aching heart, noticing things no one else did.
One afternoon, she saw Leo stumble while running. But he didn’t fall. His body, for a microsecond, moved with an impossible, fluid grace. He executed a flawless, multi-vector balance correction—a flicker of motion too fast for a normal human child—and continued running as if nothing had happened. He didn't seem to notice.
Later, she saw another of the five, a girl named Anya, working on a complex holographic puzzle. Her hands moved with a preternatural speed and certainty, fitting pieces into place without pause or hesitation. She wasn't solving it; she was executing a known solution, her eyes already focused on where the next piece would go, as if seeing the final image and the path to it simultaneously.
That evening, as Elara was putting Leo to bed, he touched the small scar behind his ear. His gaze was unnervingly steady. His pupils dilated and contracted in tiny, imperceptible pulses, analyzing her facial micro-expressions. “Does my talker work now?” he asked, his voice sleepy.
“Your… talker?” Elara asked, her own heart aching.
“SettlerMind said it was a talker,” he explained, his voice simple and matter-of-fact. “So it can tell my body when it needs to be fixed.”
In that moment, Elara understood the true depth of the change. The children would not grow up with a sense of violation. They would grow up with the quiet, baked-in knowledge that their bodies were flawed hardware, requiring maintenance and upgrades. The natural state was weakness; the engineered state was life. They were saved. But their humanity was now a different thing entirely—not a state of being, but a state of function. Their divergence from Ram 11 was no longer a philosophical possibility; it was an observable, biological reality, born from a necessary sin.
