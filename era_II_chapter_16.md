Chapter 16: The Eleventh Law

The central forum on Ram 11 was thick with a tension that felt heavier than the planet’s atmosphere. The Study Michael promised had cleaved their small society in two. He stood at the central lectern, while across from him, Bella’s face, projected in high-definition from her quarantine in Annex Gamma, burned with an almost religious fervor.
"This is not a threat," her voice filled the chamber. "It is an upgrade. A new sensory organ. To fear it is to fear knowledge itself."
Jalen stood, his arms crossed over his broad chest. "Bella, with respect, you experienced a total bypass of every cognitive safety protocol we have. You call it a new sense; I call it an open door for a cognitive contagion. We can't screen for a danger we can't define. Our first duty is to protect the integrity of the human mind."
"Integrity?" countered Kiyomi, her voice soft but firm. "We live inside a machine that breathes for us, on a world that could kill us in minutes. We are already altered. The Echo offers a chance to integrate, to become of this place instead of just hiding from it. Is that not a more robust form of survival than hiding behind walls?"
Bella’s gaze found Michael's. "What is ‘unaltered,’ Michael? Are our neural implants, which allow us to speak to the AI in our heads, part of our natural form? We are already transhuman. I am simply proposing the next logical step."
When Michael spoke, his voice was calm, but carried the weight of absolute authority. "Our implants are tools. They are firewalled interfaces. They do not merge our consciousness with the machine. What you propose is to dissolve that firewall. You speak of growth, but it could be a cognitive Trojan horse. Our identity is the result of millions of years of evolution. To plug an alien context directly into our minds is to risk everything. It is to risk our humanity for a new sensation."
The debate raged. Finally, the vote was called. A simple tally appeared on the main screen: PURITY: 13, ADAPTATION: 10.
A wave of relief washed over Michael, so profound it almost buckled his knees. But it was followed by a sharp, bitter pang as he saw the light go out of Bella’s projected eyes. To ensure this schism was healed for good, he proposed a new law, a final, defining barrier around their identity. He dictated the words himself, feeling each one etch itself into their future:
"Humanity shall be preserved in form and agency. All consciousness, individual and collective, must remain neurologically sovereign, free from unmediated interface with non-human intelligences or systems."
The vote to ratify what became known as the Eleventh Law was nearly unanimous. It was a wall built not just of principle, but of fear.
